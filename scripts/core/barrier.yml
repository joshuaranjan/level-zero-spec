details:
    - "This is a special-case system level barrier that can be used to ensure global observability of writes; typically needed after a producer (e.g., NIC) performs direct writes to the device's memory (e.g., Direct RDMA writes).  This is typically required when the memory corresponding to the writes is subsequently accessed from a remote device."
